This branch enables the CMS module which can measure the power of NetFPGA PLUS through PCIe.

Current design has specifically optimizations for the AU280. Timing constraints and placement have been modified. And all possibilities of interfaces for models other than AU280 have been commented out in "top.v" and "top_wrapper.sv".

Currently, the tx and rx port of nf_attachment_dma in "top.v" are connected together.

lm-sensors is used to measure power. To install lm-sensors framework:
$ sudo apt install lm-sensors

To measure the power of NetFPGA-PLUS:
$ sensors
